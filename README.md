# Crypts of the Lost
An MMO Dungeon Crawler Roguelite inspired by [Hypixel Skyblock](https://hypixel.net/categories/skyblock.194/)

# Quirks
Crypts of the Lost is a bit of a quirky game, here are some of the weird and wonderful things about it:
- Crypts of the Lost is server software only, there is no official client for the game, you may write your own using
  bindings, either official or community made; or you can use one another person in the community made!
- Automation and bot creation is permitted and encouraged, we want you to automate the game using code and try to push 
  it to its boundaries.
- It's also free, and open source!

# Building
To build the server-side software, you can follow these instructions

## Prerequisites
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

## Compilation
To compile the game for development, you need a single command
```bash
$ cargo xtask build
```
If you wish to self-host, we are working on a book that will go into full detail on that.
